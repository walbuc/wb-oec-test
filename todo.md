## To do

Use cypress fixtures & do not request oec apis. ðŸ™ƒ Try to use msw to intercept
request on the fly. Trigger actions only/and on pull requests? Add cy testing on
github prod workflow. Update project structure to use route files and not
pages/api for file/logic colocation.

add error boundaries.

use docker files for dev

Also use cypress fixtures instead of actually requesting apis. Maybe use MSW
with next js to intercept requests. Add for dev a local database with docker
etc.

change loading combo. sacar scroll Redirect to /home when auth user and "/"
